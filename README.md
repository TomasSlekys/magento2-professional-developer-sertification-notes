# Section 1: Magento Architecture & Customization Techniques (33%)

## 1.1 Describe the Magento module-based architecture

---
> ### Describe module architecture. 
---
> ### What are the significant steps to add a new module? 
---
> ### What are the different Composer package types? 

| Name | Package Type | Description |
| :--: | :----------: | :---------- |
| Metapackage | metapackage | Technically, a Composer package type, not a Magento component type. A metapackage consists of only a `composer.json` file that specifies a list of components and their dependencies. For example, both Magento Open Source and Magento Commerce are metapackages. |
| Module | magento2-module | Code that modifies Magento application behavior. You can upload a single module to the Magento Marketplace or your module can be dependent on some parent package. |
| Theme | magento2-theme | Code that modifies the look and feel of the storefront or Magento Admin. |
| Language Package | magento2-language | Translations for the storefront or Admin. |
| Library | magento2-library | Support for libraries located in `lib/internal` instead of in the `vendor` directory. |
| Component | magento2-component | The package formed of the files that must be located in root (`.htaccess`, etc). This includes dev/tests and setup as well for now. |

> ### When would you place a module in the app/code folder versus another location?

Use `app/code/` for development or project-specific modules. Custom built modules and modules you build to extend other functionality.

Use `vendor/` for public modules (version controlled)

Root directory location  
A component’s root directory matches the component’s name and contains all its subdirectories and files. Based on how you installed Magento, you can put your component’s root directory in one of two places:

`<Magento install directory>/app`: This is the recommended location for component development. You can set up this environment by Cloning the Magento 2 GitHub repository.

* For modules, use `app/code`.
* For storefront themes, use `app/design/frontend`.
* For Admin themes, use `app/design/adminhtml`.
* For language packages, use `app/i18n`.

`<Magento install directory>/vendor`: You will find this location for installations that use the composer create-project to install the Magento 2 metapackage (which downloads the CE or EE code).

Magento installs third-party components in the `<Magento install directory>/vendor` directory. But we recommend adding your components to the `<Magento install directory>/app/code` directory. If you add your component to the `<Magento install directory>/vendor` directory, Git will ignore it because Magento adds the vendor directory to the `<Magento install directory>/.gitignore` file.

```diff
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="declarative_table">
+       <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="date_closed" padding="10" comment="Time of event"/>
    </table>
</schema>
```

Source: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/extension-dev-guide/declarative-schema/db-schema.html#add-a-column-to-table

---

> ### How do you modify a table added by another module? 

The following example adds the `footer_content` column to the `cms_page` table.

```xml
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="cms_page" resource="default" engine="innodb" comment="CMS Page Table">
        <column xsi:type="mediumtext" name="footer_content" nullable="true" comment="Page Footer Content"/>
    </table>
</schema>
```

---

> ### How do you delete a column? 

To drop a column in the same module, remove the node from `db_schema.xml`. The following example removes the `date_closed` column by deleting its `column` node:

```diff
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="declarative_table">
        <column xsi:type="int" name="id_column" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Entity Id"/>
        <column xsi:type="int" name="severity" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Severity code"/>
        <column xsi:type="varchar" name="title" nullable="false" length="255" comment="Title"/>
        <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="time_occurred" padding="10" comment="Time of event"/>
-       <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="date_closed" padding="10" comment="Time of event"/>
        <constraint xsi:type="primary" referenceId="PRIMARY">
            <column name="id_column"/>
        </constraint>
    </table>
</schema>
```

To drop a column declared in another module, redeclare it with the `disabled` attribute set to `true`:

```xml
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="declarative_table">
        <column name="date_closed" disabled="true" />
    </table>
</schema>
```

---

> ### How do you add an index or foreign key using declarative schema? 

**Add an index**  
Use the `index` node.  
The following example adds the `INDEX_SEVERITY` index to the `declarative_table` table.

```diff
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="declarative_table">
        <column xsi:type="int" name="id_column" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Entity Id"/>
        <column xsi:type="int" name="severity" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Severity code"/>
        <column xsi:type="text" name="title" nullable="false" length="255" comment="Title"/>
        <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="time_occurred" padding="10" comment="Time of event"/>
        <constraint xsi:type="primary" referenceId="PRIMARY">
            <column name="id_column"/>
        </constraint>
+       <index referenceId="INDEX_SEVERITY" indexType="btree">
+           <column name="severity"/>
+       </index>
    </table>
</schema>
```

Source: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/extension-dev-guide/declarative-schema/db-schema.html#add-an-index

**Create a foreign key**  
Use the `constraint` node  
In the following example, the selected `constraint` node defines the characteristics of the `FL_ALLOWED_SEVERITIES` foreign key.

```diff
<schema xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Setup/Declaration/Schema/etc/schema.xsd">
    <table name="declarative_table">
        <column xsi:type="int" name="id_column" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Entity Id"/>
        <column xsi:type="int" name="severity" padding="10" unsigned="true" nullable="false" comment="Severity code"/>
        <column xsi:type="varchar" name="title" nullable="false" length="255" comment="Title"/>
        <column xsi:type="timestamp" name="time_occurred" padding="10" comment="Time of event"/>
        <constraint xsi:type="primary" referenceId="PRIMARY">
            <column name="id_column"/>
        </constraint>
+       <constraint xsi:type="foreign" referenceId="FL_ALLOWED_SEVERITIES" table="declarative_table"
+               column="severity" referenceTable="severities" referenceColumn="severity_identifier"
+               onDelete="CASCADE"/>
    </table>
</schema>
```

> ### How do you manipulate data using data patches? 

**What is a data patch?**  
A data patch is a class that contains data modification instructions. It is defined in a `<Vendor>/<Module_Name>/Setup/Patch/Data/<Patch_Name>.php` file and implements `\Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\DataPatchInterface`.

The following code sample defines a data patch class that has a dependency.

```php
<?php
    /**
     * Copyright © Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.
     * See COPYING.txt for license details.
     */

    namespace Magento\DummyModule\Setup\Patch\Data;

    use Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\DataPatchInterface;
    use Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\PatchRevertableInterface;

    /**
     */
    class DummyPatch
        implements DataPatchInterface,
        PatchRevertableInterface
    {
        /**
         * @var \Magento\Framework\Setup\ModuleDataSetupInterface
         */
        private $moduleDataSetup;

        /**
         * @param \Magento\Framework\Setup\ModuleDataSetupInterface $moduleDataSetup
         */
        public function __construct(
            \Magento\Framework\Setup\ModuleDataSetupInterface $moduleDataSetup
        ) {
            /**
             * If before, we pass $setup as argument in install/upgrade function, from now we start
             * inject it with DI. If you want to use setup, you can inject it, with the same way as here
             */
            $this->moduleDataSetup = $moduleDataSetup;
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function apply()
        {
            $this->moduleDataSetup->getConnection()->startSetup();
            //The code that you want apply in the patch
            //Please note, that one patch is responsible only for one setup version
            //So one UpgradeData can consist of few data patches
            $this->moduleDataSetup->getConnection()->endSetup();
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public static function getDependencies()
        {
            /**
             * This is dependency to another patch. Dependency should be applied first
             * One patch can have few dependencies
             * Patches do not have versions, so if in old approach with Install/Ugrade data scripts you used
             * versions, right now you need to point from patch with higher version to patch with lower version
             * But please, note, that some of your patches can be independent and can be installed in any sequence
             * So use dependencies only if this important for you
             */
            return [
                SomeDependency::class
            ];
        }

        public function revert()
        {
            $this->moduleDataSetup->getConnection()->startSetup();
            //Here should go code that will revert all operations from `apply` method
            //Please note, that some operations, like removing data from column, that is in role of foreign key reference
            //is dangerous, because it can trigger ON DELETE statement
            $this->moduleDataSetup->getConnection()->endSetup();
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getAliases()
        {
            /**
             * This internal Magento method, that means that some patches with time can change their names,
             * but changing name should not affect installation process, that's why if we will change name of the patch
             * we will add alias here
             */
            return [];
        }
    }
